This is a repository of some simple code to showcase a few methods that we are seeing in class.

The code K_means.R proivdes a laboratory to test the Lloyd's algorithm for different specifications of a location - scale model. 

In the folder "Grouped-Patterns code" you can find a Matlab file that computes the GFE estimator with group-specific coefficients for the data "Income and Democracy" application in Bonhomme and Manresa ECMA 2015. For more code download replication packages of the [orginal paper](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/sik5kir4heeaj2ymgt244/Bonhomme_Manresa_codes.zip?dl=0&e=2&rlkey=xs35hbvnd7a67ej4tc0bjkl3q).
